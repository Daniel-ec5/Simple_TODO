# Simple_TODO
The To-Do List app is a simple yet functional task manager built to practice and demonstrate key JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and localStorage for persistent data storage.

Features:

Add tasks: Users can input new tasks which are immediately displayed in the task list.

Delete tasks: Individual tasks can be removed via a delete button next to each item.

Mark tasks as complete: Tasks can be toggled as completed with a visual indicator.

Persistent storage: All tasks and their statuses are saved to the browserâ€™s localStorage so that the list persists across page reloads.

Dynamic DOM updates: The app responds instantly to user actions by updating the DOM accordingly without refreshing the page.

Basic validation: Prevents empty tasks from being added.

This project reinforces understanding of:

Manipulating the DOM to create, update, and delete elements dynamically.

Using event listeners to handle user interactions like clicks and form submissions.

Leveraging localStorage to save and retrieve JSON data for persistence.

Applying ES6+ features such as arrow functions, const/let, and template literals.
